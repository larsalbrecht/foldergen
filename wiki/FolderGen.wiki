FolderGen is to generate automatically folders and files using a config file (called: foldergenconf). You can specify content for files to fill them automatically.

== What is FolderGen? ==
FolderGen is a Java Application (Command Line and GUI) that can generate folders and files (with content) automatically. 

== General information to start ==
